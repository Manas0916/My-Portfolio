            <small>Feature Design and Development for GFG WRITE Portal</small>
            <li>
              Enhanced code block functionality in GFG article editor by
              streamlining language selection, implementing drag-and-drop
              ordering, integrating GPT for multi-language code generation, and
              designing a backend regex solution to selectively hide driver
              code, improving user experience and workflow efficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upgraded the WRITE portalâ€™s React version from 16 to 18 to enable
              new feature integrations and enhance performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed and developed the page creation feature by migrating from
              the Origin server to the WRITE portal, resulting in a 30% cost
              reduction and saving Rs. 1.5 million per month.
            </li>
            <li>
              Optimised the tags addition for articles from a two step procedure
              to a single one which resulted in enhanced user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automated the file upload functionality of the code editor by
              implementing Custom File Upload Plugins which resulted in 20%
              increase in the file addition process.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed and implemented database lock within the quiz database to
              ensure data integrity and maintain atomicity, enabling efficient
              management of data and concurrency control.
